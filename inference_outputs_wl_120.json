The addition of water will initiate hydrolysis of the TiCl4.\n- **Stir the Mixture**: Ensure the mixture is well mixed to ensure uniform reaction.\n\n#### Step 4: Heating\n- **Heat the Mixture**: Heat the reactor to a temperature of 60\u00b0C for 2 hours. This step will allow the hydrolysis reaction to proceed.\n\n#### Step 5: Cooling\n- **Cool the Mixture**: After the heating period, cool the reactor to room temperature. This will stop the reaction and allow the formation of Ti(OH)4.\n\n#### Step 6: Filtration\n- **Filter the Precipitate**: Filter the cooled mixture to separate the precipitated Ti(OH)4 from the liquid. This step is crucial to obtain the solid product.\n\n#### Step 7: Washing\n- **Wash the Precipitate**: Wash the filtered precipitate with distilled water to remove any remaining impurities. This step is necessary to achieve high purity of Ti(OH)4.\n\n#### Step 8: Drying\n- **Dry the Precipitate**: Dry the washed precipitate at 60\u00b0C for 2 hours to remove any remaining moisture. This will ensure the final product is dry and ready for further use.\n\n#### Step 9: Characterization\n- **Characterize the Product**: Perform characterization techniques (e.g., X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy) to confirm the formation of Ti(OH)4.\n\n### Final Product:\n- **Ti(OH)4**: The synthesized titanium(IV) hydroxide is now ready for use in various applications, such as in the production of pigments or as a precursor for other titanium compounds.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following these steps, you have successfully synthesized titanium(IV) hydroxide, Ti(OH)4.

The detailed step-by-step synthesis pathway is as follows:\n\n### Materials Needed\n1. **Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate** (Co(NO3)2\u00b76H2O)\n2. **Iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate** (Fe(NO3)3\u00b79H2O)\n3. **Ethylene glycol** (C2H4(OH)2)\n4. **Ammonium hydroxide** (NH4OH)\n5. **Distilled water** (H2O)\n\n### Synthesis Steps\n1. **Preparation of Precursors Solution**:\n   - **Step 1**: Dissolve 1.0 g of cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate in 20 mL of distilled water to form a clear solution. This is the precursor solution for cobalt.\n   - **Step 2**: Dissolve 2.0 g of iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate in another 20 mL of distilled water to form a separate clear solution. This is the precursor solution for iron.\n\n2. **Mixing Precursors**:\n   - **Step 3**: Combine the two precursor solutions prepared in steps 1 and 2 in a 1:2 ratio (cobalt:iron) in a suitable container. This results in a mixed precursor solution.\n\n3. **Addition of Ethylene Glycol**:\n   - **Step 4**: Add 1.0 mL of ethylene glycol to the mixed precursor solution. This step helps to initiate the gelation process.\n\n4. **Addition of Ammonium Hydroxide**:\n   - **Step 5**: Add 1.0 mL of ammonium hydroxide to the solution. This introduces a basic environment which promotes the formation of the desired oxide.\n\n5. **Gelation and Aging**:\n   - **Step 6**: Allow the mixed solution to gelate at room temperature (approximately 25\u00b0C) for 2 hours. This step is crucial for the formation of the precursor gel.\n\n6. **Calcination**:\n   - **Step 7**: After gelation, transfer the precursor gel into a furnace and heat it at 500\u00b0C for 2 hours. This step is aimed at decomposing the organic precursors and forming the desired oxide.\n\n7. **Cooling**:\n   - **Step 8**: After calcination, allow the sample to cool down to room temperature naturally.\n\n8. **Final Step:**\n   - **Step 9**: The final product is CoFe2O4, which can be collected and characterized using appropriate techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) for phase identification and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphology analysis.\n\n### Characterization\n- **Characterization Techniques**: After synthesizing CoFe2O4, the material can be characterized using various techniques to determine its phase purity, crystallite size, and morphology. Some common characterization techniques include:\n  - **X-ray Diffraction (XRD)**: To confirm the phase purity of the synthesized material.\n  - **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)**: To analyze the surface morphology and size of the particles.\n  - **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)**: To study the microstructure and size of the particles in detail.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis detailed pathway outlines the synthesis of CoFe2O4 through a sol-gel method involving the controlled addition of precursors, ethylene glycol, and ammonium hydroxide. The final product can be characterized using various techniques to determine its phase purity and morphology."]
