This process emphasizes eco-friendliness and efficiency. The study compares three synthesis methods: coprecipitation, solid-state, and evaporation, focusing on the coprecipitation method as the most effective in terms of catalyst activity.\n\n## Steps\n\n- **Step 1:** ZnCl\u2082 and SnCl\u2084\u00b75H\u2082O are dissolved in deionized water to prepare a solution with a Zn\/Sn molar ratio of 2.\n- **Step 2:** A 4 M NaOH solution is added dropwise to the metal salt solution under stirring to precipitate the hydroxides.\n- **Step 3:** The precipitate is stirred for 3 hours at room temperature.\n- **Step 4:** The mixture is filtered, and the precipitate is washed with deionized water to remove chlorides.\n- **Step 5:** The washed precipitate is dried at 120\u00b0C overnight.\n- **Step 6:** The dried material is calcined at 600\u00b0C for 4 hours under static air to yield the Zn\u2013Sn composite oxide catalyst, specifically designated as Zn\u2082Sn-CoPre-600.\n","1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":null,"42":null,"43":null,"44":null,"45":null,"46":null,"47":null,"48":null,"49":null,"50":null,"51":null,"52":null,"53":null,"54":null,"55":null,"56":null,"57":null,"58":null,"59":null,"60":null,"61":null,"62":null,"63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":null,"67":null,"68":null,"69":null,"70":null,"71":null,"72":null,"73":null,"74":null,"75":null,"76":null,"77":null,"78":null,"79":null,"80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":null,"84":null,"85":null,"86":null,"87":null,"88":null,"89":null,"90":null,"91":null,"92":null,"93":null,"94":null,"95":null,"96":null,"97":null,"98":null,"99":null}}
